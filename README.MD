# 🧭 Travel Planner Agent

## 📘 Overview
The **Travel Planner Agent** is an AI-powered system designed to generate personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences such as destination, travel dates, budget, and interests.  
It leverages **Agentic AI**, Large Language Models (LLMs) and external APIs (like Amadeus) to integrate real-time flight, hotel, and sightseeing data into a seamless, day-wise itinerary.

This project demonstrates the power of **Generative AI and Agentic Architecture** in creating intelligent, user-driven planning experiences.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Travelers often struggle to plan a complete trip that includes sightseeing, accommodations, and travel options. Travel companies aim to provide a personalized itinerary that meets user preferences and offers a seamless experience.

### 🎯 Goal
Build an AI-driven travel planner that:
- Takes user preferences (destination, travel dates, interests, budget, etc.)
- Retrieves and filters relevant data (flights, hotels, attractions)
- Generates a **personalized, day-wise itinerary** with details for each day
- Outputs the final itinerary as a **structured summary and downloadable PDF**

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
✅ **LLM-powered Recommendations:** Uses Azure OpenAI API (via `openai_llm.py`) to interpret and generate natural language itineraries.  
✅ **Dynamic Data Integration:** Fetches real-time flight and hotel data using the **Amadeus API** (`amadeus_helper.py`).  
✅ **Graph-based Workflow:** Orchestrates interdependent nodes (`attr_nodes`, `flights_nodes`, `hotels_nodes`, `itinerary_nodes`, `user_nodes`) in a **parallelized decision pipeline**, where data fetching for attractions, flights, and hotels occurs **simultaneously** after user input is captured. The results are then merged to generate a complete, optimized itinerary.  
✅ **State Management:** Maintains conversation and decision context through the `state` module.  
✅ **Streamlit UI:** Provides an interactive front-end for user input and itinerary display.  
✅ **Export & Visualization:** Generates a final PDF itinerary (`travel_itinerary.pdf`) and visual graph (`Graph_image.jpg`).

## 🧠 Architecture

The project follows a **modular, agentic, and parallelized architecture** that efficiently builds a travel itinerary through coordinated node execution.

1. **Start:** The process begins with `fetch_user_data`, where the system collects user preferences such as destination, dates, and budget from the free text fed in by the user via the Streamlit UI.  
2. **Parallel Data Retrieval:** Once user data is available, three independent branches run **in parallel**:
   - `get_attr_details` → `get_top_attr_details` (for sightseeing and attractions)  
   - `get_flight_details` → `get_top_flight_details` (for flight options)  
   - `get_hotel_details` → `get_top_hotel_details` (for accommodations)  
3. **Itinerary Generation:** The results from all three parallel branches are merged in the `get_itinerary` node, which compiles a **day-wise itinerary** with flights, hotels, and attractions.  
4. **End:** The final output is a **personalized travel itinerary**, available as both a structured summary and a downloadable PDF (`travel_itinerary.pdf`).

A visual representation of the graph can be found in `Graph_image.jpg`.

## 🏁 Future Enhancements

- **Voice-Based Trip Requests:**  
  Enable speech-to-text functionality so users can verbally describe their travel plans instead of typing, making the experience more natural and hands-free.

- **Real-Time Availability Checks:**  
  Integrate live APIs to instantly verify flight and hotel availability, ensuring all itinerary options are accurate and up to date before confirmation.

- **Interactive Map Visualization:**  
  Embed dynamic maps within the UI to visualize hotels, attractions, and travel routes, providing users with better spatial awareness and trip context.

- **Collaborative Trip Mode:**  
  Introduce a shared planning mode where multiple users can co-create an itinerary, merge preferences, and finalize trip details together.
